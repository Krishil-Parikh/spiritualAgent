üì¶ Installation
Follow these steps to set up DSCPL on your computer:

Clone the Repository (or download the code):
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dscpl.git
cd dscpl

Note: Replace your-username with the actual repository owner, or download the ZIP file and extract it.

Create a Virtual Environment (recommended): This keeps your project‚Äôs dependencies separate from other Python projects.
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies: The app requires several Python libraries. Install them using the provided requirements.txt file.
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don‚Äôt have a requirements.txt, install these packages manually:
pip install streamlit langchain langchain_community langchain_huggingface faiss-cpu google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client icalendar pytz requests pandas


Set Up Google Calendar API (optional, for calendar integration):

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project and enable the Google Calendar API.
Download the credentials.json file and place it in the project‚Äôs root folder.
Follow the prompts during the app‚Äôs first run to authenticate.


Prepare Configuration:

Ensure you have write permissions in the project folder for saving chat history, reminders, and progress.
No additional API keys are required for basic functionality, but you‚Äôll need a valid Flic-Token for video fetching (included in the code).

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
Here are solutions to common issues:

Streamlit doesn‚Äôt start:

Ensure you‚Äôre in the correct directory and the virtual environment is active.
Check that all dependencies are installed: pip install -r requirements.txt.


Google Calendar integration fails:

Verify that credentials.json is in the project folder.
Delete token.json and re-authenticate.
Ensure you‚Äôve enabled the Google Calendar API in Google Cloud Console.


Videos don‚Äôt load:

Check your internet connection.
The API token may be invalid. Contact the repository owner for an updated Flic-Token.


Chat responses are slow:

The AI model may be processing large histories. Try clearing history.json (back it up first).


Error messages:

Read the error in the terminal or browser for clues.
Search the error online or open an issue for help.



For other issues, check the Issues page or ask for help.
